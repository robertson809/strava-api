## Playing with my run data from Strava's API 
### by Michael Robertson for fun

Benefitted from tutorials on one-time setup difficulies by referencing tutorials from franchyze923 on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgscChKfGyg&t=258s&ab_channel=franchyze923) and [GitHub](https://github.com/franchyze923/Code_From_Tutorials/tree/master/Strava_Api)
and another by Matt Ambrogi [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/using-the-strava-api-and-pandas-to-explore-your-activity-data-d94901d9bfde).

Hope to update this to include interface with an Raspberry Pi or Arduino to bring the project full circle to the physical world.
